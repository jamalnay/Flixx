## Flixx: Display latest movies and shows from an APi using JavaScript
Flixx is a small JavaScript project to display the latest movies and shows.
I have created this project during my journey to learn JavaScript. It incorporates the [Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper) library for a movie carousel and uses data from The Movie Database [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) API.
